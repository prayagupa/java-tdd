Non functional Testing/ Perf Testing
--------------------------------------

Practices

- should run single user flow tests in order to understand the baseline measurements.
- should run the Load Tests to understand the average and p90 metrics
- should run the Peak Load Tests to understand the service behaviour under peak load.
- should define the baseline concurrent requests, CPU utilization, Memory utilization, Latency(max, acceptable)
- should run Stress Testing
- should run Scalability Testing
